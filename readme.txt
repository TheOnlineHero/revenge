Take Revenge on your attacker!!!

== Description ==

There's plenty of software out there that helps protect your site against hackers, but not many return fire. This plugin doesn't block hackers, it fires back and attacks them.

How does it do this, well it uses good old fashion Zip Bomb Attack method. If a hacker attempts to hack your site, they are served a 4GB decompressed file that they have no choice but to download. When this happens, their computer will run out of memory and hard drive space and basically will crash, knocking them off the internet.

This plugin does not attack all hackers. For example if they guess your password, this plugin will not protect you. However if they use a bot to attack your site, it will work against them.
